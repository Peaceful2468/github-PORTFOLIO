‎Introduction.
‎This portfolio showcases my journey through a data analysis class, with Digital Skillup Africa for the period of 3 to 4months.
‎Where I gained foundational knowledge and practical skills in data analysis using Microsoft Excel, SQL Server (Structured Query Language) and Power Bi.
‎Key Takeaways.
‎1. Foundation of Data: I learned the basics of data analysis, including data types, data visualization, and data storytelling.
‎2. Introduction to Microsoft Excel: I became familiar with Excel's interface, formulas, and functions, enabling me to efficiently manage and analyze data.
‎3. Basic Functions in Excel: I mastered essential Excel functions, such as:
‎- Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, grouping)
‎- Formula writing (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.)
‎- Data visualization (charts, tables, pivot tables)
‎4. Report: I applied my knowledge to create a comprehensive report, demonstrating my ability to collect, analyze, and present data insights.
‎Skills Acquired;
‎✓Data analysis and visualization
‎✓Excel proficiency (formulas, functions, pivot tables)
‎✓Data storytelling and reporting
‎✓Critical thinking and problem-solving
‎SQL and Data Systems.
‎Explored various SQL systems:
‎- PostgreSQL
‎- MySQL
‎- Oracle DB
‎- SQL Server
‎- Google BigQuery
‎- SQLite
‎I Understood that these systems share the same structured query language (SQL) but differ in their operating systems and specific features.
‎Data Types.
‎✓There are three types of data:
‎1. Structured data: Organized and formatted data (e.g., tables, databases)
‎2. Semi-structured data: Data with some level of organization but needs to be cleaned out before analysing.(e.g., XML, JSON)
‎3. Unstructured data: Unorganized data (e.g., text, images, videos)
‎Data Roles.
‎✓Differentiated between various data roles:
‎1. Data Scientist: Analyzes complex data to gain insights and make predictions
‎2. Data Analyst: Interprets and analyzes data to inform business decisions
‎3. Data Engineer: Designs, builds, and maintains large-scale data systems
‎4. Data Administrator: manages and maintains databases
‎5. Business Intelligence Developer: develops data visualization and reporting tools
‎6. Analytics Engineer: Builds and maintains data pipelines and architectures
‎SQL Fundamentals.
‎Learned about;
‎✓SQL Basics: Data types, queries, and commands
‎✓Database concepts: Advantages, data storage, and retrieval
‎✓SQL command types:
‎- DDL (Data Definition Language)
‎- DML (Data Manipulation Language)
‎- DCL (Data Control Language)
‎- TCL (Transaction Control Language)
‎- DQL (Data Query Language)
‎SQL Keys.
‎✓Understood various SQL keys:
‎1. Super key: A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.
‎2. Candidate key: A minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.
‎3. Composite key: A combination of two or more attributes that uniquely identifies a row.
‎4. Primary key: A unique identifier for each row.
‎5. Alternate key: A candidate key that is not the primary key.
‎6. Surrogate key: An artificial key used as a primary key.
‎7. Foreign key: A field that references the primary key of another table
‎SQL Queries and Functions.
‎Learned about:
‎✓SQL query basics: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses
‎✓SQL joins: INNER, RIGHT, LEFT, and FULL joins
‎✓SQL aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN
‎✓SQL set operations: UNION, UNION ALL, and INTERSECT
‎✓SQL Views and CASE statement.
‎SQL Queries and Functions
‎This section covers the essential SQL queries and functions that enable you to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data in a database.
‎SQL Query Basics
‎~SELECT: Retrieves specific columns or all columns (*) from a table.
‎~FROM: Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.
‎~WHERE: Filters data based on conditions (e.g., WHERE column = 'value').
‎~GROUP BY: Groups data by one or more columns and applies aggregate functions.
‎~HAVING: Filters grouped data based on conditions (e.g., HAVING SUM(column) > 100).
‎~ORDER BY: Sorts data in ascending or descending order.
‎SQL Joins.
‎~INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
‎~LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
‎~RIGHT JOIN: Similar to LEFT JOIN, but returns all records from the right table.
‎~FULL JOIN: Returns all records from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there are no matches.
‎SQL Aggregate Functions
‎~COUNT: Returns the number of rows in a table or group.
‎~SUM: Calculates the total value of a column.
‎~AVERAGE: Calculates the average value of a column.
‎~MAX: Returns the maximum value in a column.
‎~MIN: Returns the minimum value in a column.
‎SQL Set Operations.
‎~UNION: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicates.
‎~UNION ALL: Similar to UNION, but includes duplicates.
‎~INTERSECT: Returns the common rows between two or more SELECT statements.
‎SQL Views.
‎✓A virtual table based on the result of a SELECT statement.
‎✓Can be used to simplify complex queries or provide an additional layer of security.
‎SQL CASE Statement
‎✓Used to perform conditional logic in a query.
‎✓ Allows you to evaluate an expression and return a specific value based on that evaluation.
‎GitHub.
‎✓What is GitHub?: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration on software development projects.
‎✓Portfolio Showcase: GitHub allows you to showcase your projects and code, demonstrating your skills to potential employers.
‎✓Collaboration Platform: GitHub enables multiple developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage versions.
